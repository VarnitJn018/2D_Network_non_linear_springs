Consider a 2D network of non-linear springs to approximate a lattice-based structure. The system should consist of nodes that are connected to neighbouring nodes with these springs (minimum 20x20 nodes, but larger is better). The nodes move in space over time governed by Newton’s law of motion and the forces acting on the nodes originate from the springs. Implement an explicit time-integration code that models the elasto-dynamic behaviour of such a system. Apply a static normal load and some type of defect as a seed for failure and model its propagation through the system by means of breaking springs based on a failure criterion of your choice (e.g., critical stretch, critical stress,…).
